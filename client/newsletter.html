            The crisis has a severe impact on business environment (new business habits, more competitors).  As a result past investments have not generated positive results and Nexans has not been performing well during the last 2 years.
        Within an environment of change, we also see market opportunities including :</p>

                <li> 1. Numerous Oil and Gas opportunities in Middle East</em></li>
                <li> 2. Ongoing electrification programs in Africa and Middle East</li>
                
              </ol>
            </p>

        
<p class="articletext">To regain competitiveness in our new business environment and harvest these opportunities, Nexans has reinforced its commercial teams in Africa and Middle East and launched a new way of managing business through Project Management. Further actions called strategic initiatives have been launched. </p>

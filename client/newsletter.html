          <h4>Dear colleagues,</h4>

              <p>By now I am sure that you are aware that we, the EMEA ID team, have been challenged to substantially develop our business in two key segments under the banner of “Group Strategic Initiatives”:</p>
              <ol class="citation2 unstyled">
                <li> •  Increase our LV/MV sales in Africa and Middle East – 2014 sales growth of -----m€ expected</li>
                <li> • Grow our Oil and Gas downstream activities in Middle East & Central Asia – 2014 sales growth of --------m€ expected.</li>
                
              </ol>  
            <p>In order to achieve these targets we must make the initiatives our top priority in 2014. Make no mistake, this is going to require a huge effort from our product managers, technical teams, sales managers & market segment directors. This will not be “Business as usual”!</p>

          <h2>Your votes & comments of the Newsletter on December 2013</h2>
          <p>Results of VOTING: “I understand the strategic initiatives / I don’t understand”: </p>
          <p>15% said they don’t understand the strategic initiatives. 85% confirmed that they do understand. It is rather encouraging but will make sure that we keep giving details about the initiatives in order to have everyone onboard</p>
          <p>Your comment: “...team spirit and commitment…”: After a few months of existence of the initiatives, the editorial team can only praise the commitment and efforts of the participants as well as their professionalism. Great team spirit indeed.</p>
          <p>Your comment: “…vision or execution…”: Strategic initiatives are translated into action plans. It is all about being practical and delivering what is expected in order to reach our growth target.</p>
          <p>Your comment: “…mining is a key business…”:  Mining is very important for the region and sales of LV/MV into mining will contribute to the initiative.</p>

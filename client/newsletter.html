          <h4>Dear colleagues,</h4>

              <p>By now I am sure that you are aware that we, the EMEA ID team, have been challenged to substantially develop our business in two key segments under the banner of “Group Strategic Initiatives”:</p>
              <ol class="citation2 unstyled">
                <li> •  Increase our LV/MV sales in Africa, Middle East & Central Europe – 2014 sales growth of 30 m€ expected</li>
                <li> • Grow our Oil & Gas downstream and Rail Infrastructure activities in Middle East & Central Asia – 2014 sales growth of 38 m€ expected.</li>
                
              </ol>  
            <p>In order to achieve these targets we must make the initiatives our top priority in 2014. Make no mistake, this is going to require a huge effort from our product managers, technical teams, sales managers & market segment directors. This will not be “Business as usual”!</p>

        <h2>GSSP is evolving...</h2>
           
            <p class="articletext">
            Starting from January GSSP (the Global Sourcing and Sales Platform) will further develop its activity by integrating the existing Export Sales Front and Back Office teams of Liban Cables in Beirut and Nexans Morocco in Casablanca into the organization. They will focus on project activity in the Middle East and Africa respectively. As a result of this evolution to our structure we will:</p>

              <ol class="citation2 unstyled">
                <li> • Capture more opportunities and ensure they are dealt with appropriately in a swift and professional manner.</em></li>
                <li> •  Develop transparency across our activities to enhance communications and avoid duplications.</li>
                <li> •  Support Field Sales teams and provide maximum coverage for our growing customer base.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
				<p class="articletext">Today GSSP consist of three teams based in Clichy & Lens in France and Mönchengladbach in Germany. In these locations we will continue to service our existing focus markets  and core customer base.</p>
<p class="articletext">The teams in Beirut and Casablanca will also continue to support their existing client base but with an increasing focus to develop traded sales in addition to locally produced products.</p>
<p class="articletext"> The ultimate goal is to have two further locations that can support complex, multiple-source projects in their respective regions.</p>
